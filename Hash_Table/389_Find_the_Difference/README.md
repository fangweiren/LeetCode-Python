### 题意
Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.  
给定两个字符串 s 和 t，它们只包含小写字母。

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.  
字符串 t 由字符串 s 随机重排，然后在随机位置添加一个字母。

Find the letter that was added in t.  
请找出在 t 中被添加的字母。

Example:
```
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
```

### 思路
因为存在 s="a" t="aa" 的情况，所以通过统计每个字母出现的次数，来找出被添加的字母。为了减少计算量，可以先遍历 s，用字典存储字母到次数的映射；再遍历 t，在字典中对出现的字母次数减一，次数出现负数的字母就是答案。

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findTheDifference(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        diff = {}
        for c in s:
            diff[c] = diff[c] + 1 if c in diff else 1
        for c in t:
            if c not in diff:
                return c
            diff[c] -= 1
            if diff[c] < 0:
                return c
```
